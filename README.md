Hello everyone, my name is Som. I'm currently an undergraduate student major in Computer Engineering. This project was created with the 
purpose that I will able to learn a lot about Python from it. I really love data analysis so I believe this will help me learn how to
utilize Python.

At the current time, I'll be using 
- InteleJ for IDE.
- Python Library (Pandas, Numpy, yfinance)

I'll be updating this constantly

Hope I will successded
